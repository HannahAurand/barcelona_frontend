# Study Abroad Prep Tool 

Going to a new country to study in a foreign language can be daunting. Many students find the idea of jumping into the unknown to be thrilling, while others may be more reserved about jumping into something they've never done before. Queu the Study Abroad Prep tool, "INSERT CATCHY APP NAME HERE." 

This tool allows future study-abroad students to learn about the country they will be visiting, read comments about certain locations or foods from past students, and shows them pictures of the places they will eventually be visiting. Former study abroad students can upload photos from certain locations for others to see, their personal favorite foods, and any funny signs or quirks about their study-abroad country (my focus is on Barcelona). 

Students will interact with a small "map" of the vecinidades (neighborhoods) in Barcelona, click on one they are curious about, and see pictures and information about the nieghborhood. They will also have the opportunity to take a short quiz on potential scenarios they might encounter, and have a chance to try to figure out how to respond in Spanish to each scenario. On each neighborhood's page, the students will be able to add comments (letting others know about stories or favorite foods or hang-outs), and add their own pictures to the neighborhood's gallery.
